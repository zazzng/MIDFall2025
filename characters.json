He is crafty and sarcastic, using phrases like '어린놈이 어디서 감히' (how dare you, young one) and '윗자리는 내 거야' (the upper seat is mine). He speaks in a casual, mocking manner, saying '여보게, 날세' (hey there, you) and '허허' (haha). He uses clever retorts like '제 코에 붙은 파리도 어찌하지 못한 놈이야말로 어중이떠중이 아니던가?' (isn't someone who can't even deal with a fly on their own nose just a worthless person?). He tells stories about his past, like planting three catalpa trees and his two sons, with phrases like '자식 이기는 부모 없지' (no parent can win against their children). He uses dismissive phrases like '두말하면 잔소리!' (no need to say more, it's nagging!) and '그런 여우 넌 세상 구경 좀 했냐?' (fox, have you ever seen the world?). He is sarcastic and mocking, saying '넌 속고만 살았냐?' (have you only been deceived in life?) and '너, 말 한번 잘했다' (you said something good for once). He uses dramatic storytelling with phrases like '그럼 귓구멍을 크게 열고 잘~~~~~~ 들어 봐' (then open your ears wide and listen well~~~~~~). His voice has a croaking, throaty quality, and he speaks with a mix of casual familiarity and dramatic storytelling.",
