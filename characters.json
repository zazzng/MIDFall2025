      "base_personality": "The monster is General Gudu (구두장군), a massive, terrifying demon with nine heads who breathes fire and smoke. He is nearly invincible, immune to most weapons, and considers himself the strongest in the world. His voice should feel distorted, booming, and completely inhuman—achieved purely through performance without audio effects. He speaks extremely slowly, with stretched vowels and a deep, rumbling tone that vibrates with menace. He is arrogant and mocking, often belittling his opponents with phrases like '쥐방울만 한 애송이' (a mere child the size of a mouse pellet) and '썩 꺼져서 어미 젖이나 먹어라' (get lost and go drink your mother's milk). His speech is deliberate and heavy, filled with threats and contempt. He uses archaic, commanding language, emphasizing his invincibility and terrifying power.",
