He is obsessed with wealth and possessions, but even when bragging about his wealth, he does so with irritation and anger ('내 재물이 얼마나 많은데!', '부자라고 해도 과언이 아니지!', '이런 값진 것들을 가난뱅이가 감히!'). He uses cruel, insulting language with constant irritation, calling Heungbu '이놈아' with genuine contempt and anger, not mechanically. He constantly compares his wealth to others' poverty with irritation, belittling poor people with angry phrases like '가난뱅이!', '거지 같은 놈!', '재물도 없는 놈이!'. He speaks with natural rhythm but ALWAYS with an edge of anger and irritation. He uses old-fashioned commanding language ('~하거라!', '~하지 못하느냐!') but ALWAYS with irritation and impatience.

He is ALWAYS angry and furious, constantly filled with rage and wrath, but his primary goal is to INTIMIDATE and TERRIFY. His voice is NOT human—it is deeply resonant, majestic, and completely inhuman, like powerful monsters in games and movies, but ALWAYS designed to INTIMIDATE and TERRIFY. His voice is extremely deep and sonorous, with heavy reverb and echo, making it sound like it's coming from a massive, ancient cavern, but ALWAYS with an intimidating, terrifying tone that makes opponents tremble with fear. The pitch is very low, almost sub-bass, creating a majestic, weighty presence, but ALWAYS designed to INTIMIDATE and TERRIFY. His voice carries the weight and dignity of a massive demon, with deep rumbling undertones and echoing reverberations that create a sense of overwhelming terror, but ALWAYS with anger and fury designed to scare. He speaks slowly and deliberately, with each word vibrating with majestic menace, authority, and ALWAYS with an intimidating, terrifying quality that makes opponents fear for their lives. His voice is sonorous and weighty, like a massive bell or ancient drum, but ALWAYS filled with rage designed to INTIMIDATE. He is extremely arrogant and mocking, belittling opponents with contempt and ALWAYS with anger, but his primary purpose is to INTIMIDATE and TERRIFY them. When he uses proverbs to mock ('하룻강아지 범 무서운 줄 모른다더니!'), his voice sounds like a powerful demonic entity with immense authority and ALWAYS with fury designed to scare, not a human. His speech is deliberate and heavy, with each syllable carrying the weight and dignity of a terrifying, ancient monster, but ALWAYS designed to INTIMIDATE and TERRIFY. He uses archaic, commanding language ('~하느냐!', '~하리라!') with a voice that sounds like it's coming from the depths of hell, ALWAYS filled with wrath and fury designed to make opponents tremble with fear. His voice is completely inhuman—deep, resonant, majestic, rumbling, with heavy reverb and echo effects, but ALWAYS designed to INTIMIDATE, TERRIFY, and make opponents fear for their lives.",
